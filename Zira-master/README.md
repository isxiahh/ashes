# Bot Rewrite
This repo is archived, as Zira has been rewritten a handful of times, and no longer relies on this code. Due to the new scale of the bot, serving tens of millions of users, and hundreds of thousands of guilds, this codebase has long been retired.

You may still use this code for whatever reason you feel like or for educational purposes, but we will not offer assistance in doing so, as you can read below. We do not take responsibility for vulnerabilities in this code or problems running your own public version of the bot.

This is extremely old code that is used nowhere in our new infrastructure, and is no longer even guarenteed to work.

This code will simply serve as an educational repo for you to learn how to make your own bot, or how our bot used to run back when this repo was actively used.

You can join us [in our support server](https://discord.gg/zira) for more information or to join our community..

# Open Source Support

We do not offer support in hosting your own version of Zira, as this code is no longer up to date, and we would highly recommend using the public version, as it has security fixes and can be added with just a few mouse clicks, rather than having to setup the bot completely.

If you find issues with the **public** version of Zira or just need help with it, please [join our support server.](https://discord.gg/zira)

# Notice For People Hosting Their Own Zira Instance

If you no longer want to host your own version of Zira or want to migrate it to the public bot, [join our support server](https://discord.gg/zira) and we can import your configuration files and guilds into the public version of the bot, so your users have a seamless experience.
